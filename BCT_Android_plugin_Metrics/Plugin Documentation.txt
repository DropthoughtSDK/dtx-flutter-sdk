This documentation includes how to integrate a flutter module/ SDK into your existing native android applications as single-page widgets for greater customization or just to run your custom dart logic,
thus greatly increasing code reusability/ logic reusability across platforms

Requirements for this module to work:
	1. Android studio
	2. Flutter's Android AAR - Android Archive file (similar to .JAR file) which has the entire functionality/ UI
	3. Java (JVM) requirements
	4. A native android application in which you wish to integrate the flutter SDK

Step 1: Add Java dependency to Android studio:

	1. Go to build.gradle in the app (app/build.gradle)
	2. Add android {
			  //...
			  compileOptions {
				sourceCompatibility 1.8
				targetCompatibility 1.8
			  }
			}

Step 2: Add the Flutter module's AAR as a dependency in app's build.gradle:

	1. Add the AAR's output file as repository dependency. Also add the flutter.io file
		
		repositories {
		  maven {
			url 'some/path/my_flutter/build/host/outputs/repo'
			// This is relative to the location of the build.gradle file
			// if using a relative path.
		  }
		  maven {
			url 'https://storage.googleapis.com/download.flutter.io'
		  }
		}
	
	*/some/path/my_flutter will be provided as part of the flutter SDK's AAR bundle. Copy the files to a specific path and include that path + /build/host/outputs/repo as dependency
	
	2. Add the debug/profile/release version's AARs:
	
	dependencies {
	  // ...
	  debugImplementation 'com.example.flutter_module:flutter_debug:1.0'
	  profileImplementation 'com.example.flutter_module:flutter_profile:1.0'
	  releaseImplementation 'com.example.flutter_module:flutter_release:1.0'
	}
	
	Note: All these AARs will be found inside the path/build/host/outputs/repo folder which was previously added as the dependency path to maven

Step 3: Add Flutter module as a FlutterActivity to your current app and integration

	1. Follow the procedures from https://flutter.dev/docs/development/add-to-app/android/add-flutter-screen for integrating the flutter module as an activity in android native application

Step 4: Add the profile build type:
	
	Add the following dependency inside android and buildTypes as
	
	android {
	//...other dependencies under android
		buildTypes {
		//...other dependencies under buildTypes
			profile {
				initWith debug
			}
		}
	}
